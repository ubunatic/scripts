# However the behavior depdends on too many things to be safely understood
# and thus you should not rely on it.
#
# If you still love Bash (as I do) then consider the following simple rules:
#
#   1. Only write small bash "programs"
#   2. Use `set -e` as a VERY rudimentary measure to make Bash scripst fail fast.
#   3. Prefer to use if-then-else or && and || to explicitly handle errors.
#   4. You must use if-then-else or && and || to handle errors in functions!
#

# The following code is shows that you cannot safely and consistently
# trap errors in functions and for loops.

# Some devs advocate to use a smart trap the checks if you are in a func or not.
